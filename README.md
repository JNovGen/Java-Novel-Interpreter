# How it works ?
The interpreter needs in input the source code of a story model (must be written by the human author). So the human author creates the story world and the rules in a specific language (defined later), then the Java Novel Interpeter chooses a possible path.

# How to write the source code of your story model ?
In theory you just need a text editor :

When the sotry model become too big, you may use a dedicated editor (at least to visualize graphically the story world). In the example, the file is converted in Cmap format and can be visualized with CmapTools :
